CS 485 Project #2

This program uses HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create a 4x4 grid for which the user can traverse. The pictures can be replaced to create an environment, and the .json can be formatted with obstacles as needed.

IMPORTANT: Running have index.html may cause issues with COR due to it opening in a risky format. A possible fix is, with python installed and in terminal opened in this repo, run this command:

python3 -m http.server

Then, go to the following website: http://localhost:8000/index.html

Where '8000' is the portnumber by default, yet could be different.

Cheers!
